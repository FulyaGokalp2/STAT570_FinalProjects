It is essential to acknowledge that minor errors may be present, and the methods employed may not necessarily reflect the optimal approach related to the data sets.

All groups aimed to construct a narrative around a data set with relevance to environmental impact, human well-being, and other related issues.

Prior to these projects, our primary focus centered on [*R4DS(2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) and [*Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R*](https://raps-with-r.dev) books for practical exercises and hands-on projects. Each group established GitHub accounts and collaborated on shared projects by forking each other's repositories. This approach was designed to provide practical experience in reproducible and open-source research, incorporating version control practices.
